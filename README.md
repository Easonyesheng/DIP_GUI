# DIP_GUI
My first repository.  
It's about a GUI to do DIP, it will contain 4 projects.  
It's based on PYQT5 and python-opencv.  
It will contain many DIP algorithms like OTSU, Entropy, different convlution algorithms etc.

# RUN
  > python /.../ImageInput.py  
  need to change a place -- the 21st line in ImageInput.py. You need to change the path there.
# The First Project
It's about very basic algorithm.  
The GUI is in Imageinput.py, it also get the gray image.  
HisGet.py is to get Histogram.  
OTSU_G.py is to do binarization by OTSU algorithm.  
ENTRO_G.py is to do binarization by Entropy method.  



# The Second Project
It's about convlution using different filters to enhance or blur
